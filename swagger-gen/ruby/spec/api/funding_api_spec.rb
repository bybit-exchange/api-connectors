  # unit tests for funding_my_last_fee
  # Funding settlement occurs every 8 hours at 00:00 UTC, 08:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC. The current interval&#39;s fund fee settlement is based on the previous interval&#39;s fund rate. For example, at 16:00, the settlement is based on the fund rate generated at 8:00. The fund rate generated at 16:00 will be used at 0:00 on the next day.
